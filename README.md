# 📚 Library Management App

This project is a **mobile application built with React Native** for managing libraries and books.  
The main goal is to **learn React Native development** and practice working with **REST APIs** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ...).

## 🚀 Project Overview
The application connects to an **API provided by a professor** as part of a university course.  
It allows users to:
- View libraries and books  
- Add new libraries or books  
- Update existing records  
- Delete items  
- Perform actions related to book checkout and management  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React Native** – Mobile development framework  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **REST API Integration** with Axios/Fetch  
- **GitHub** for version control  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of **React Native** for mobile apps  
- Learn to **consume REST APIs** (CRUD operations)  
- Manage **state and navigation** in a React Native project  
- Gain experience in **mobile UI/UX development**  

## 📦 Features (Planned/Implemented)
- ✅ Fetch and display data from the API  
- ✅ Create new libraries and books  
- ✅ Update library/book details
